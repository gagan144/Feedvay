Owlery
======

Owlery inspired from famous 'Harry Potter' series is an app responsible for delivering messages to the user.
As depicted in the series, owlery is a place where all the school owls and the owls belonging to students
are kept. Anyone who wishes to send a message must handover it over to intended owl which then delivers the
message to the receiver.

This app follows the same concept. For each delivery mechanism (SMS/Email) an owl is kept with predefined templates.
Any process/routine that wants to send a message must handover the message to the corresponding owl using template,
which then handles all delivery challenges. All log are maintained in the database for future reference.
